# RewardClaim

A fork of [Dance-Dog/RewardClaim](https://github.com/Dance-Dog/RewardClaim) but actually working +
- no hover animation. just rewards.
- no "Ready?" button
- dailystreak info

## Licensing
[Original](https://github.com/Dance-Dog/RewardClaim) didn't have any license thus its ARR, I'd like to contact [Dance-Dog](https://github.com/Dance-Dog) but seems like he vanished in 2020, which means I might need to rewrite whole thing from scratch in future
